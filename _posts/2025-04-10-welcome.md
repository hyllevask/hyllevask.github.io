This is my very first blog post! ðŸŽ‰

For a long time, I have wanted to create a personal website with some information and a blog. I have finally found a solution that fits me. I am using github pages with a custom domain and Jekyll. 

I feel so fed up with social media and never share anything there anymore. I hope that this is a more inspiring way to share things, even though no one will read it. Right now wverything on this website is in english. I have not decided if I will keep it so or if I will change to Swedish.
